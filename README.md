# ua-keylayout-macos
Ukrainian Unicode keyboard layout, compatible with macOS High Sierra (and, probably, higher)

## Installing for all users
The only catch is to add .bundle file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`, as otherwise macOS keeps "forgetting" about individual .keylayout and .icns files placed there after rebooting.
